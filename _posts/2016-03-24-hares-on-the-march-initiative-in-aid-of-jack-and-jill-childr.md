> Hares on the March initiative in aid of Jack and Jill Children's Foundation generated just over €63k at the live auction and €85k via the online auction which ended on Mon 21st Mar, it was is well over the estimated target. It has been a truly fantastic event, I would like to thank everyone who bid on Lepus Hare, it was hell for leather in the final hours of the online auction, bumping Lepus Hare up to €1,160... all the proceeds going to Hares on the March
